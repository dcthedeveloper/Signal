## üé® Code Style

### General Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### ESLint
We use ESLint to enforce code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

All code must pass linting before being merged.

### Component Structure
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { SomeIcon } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button, Card } from '../components/shared/ui';

const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);

  const handleAction = () => {
    // Handler logic
  };

  return (
    <div className="container">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Use semantic color variables (primary, secondary, etc.)
- Maintain responsive design
